Implementation:
support for [ ] brackets for (quoted ?) program fragments
	may need to add a tokenize step before parse

treat morphemes correctly
	need to parse them as distinct from identifiers
	need to be able to store / look up bindings correctly
	     separate datatype for words and morphemes (currently conflated via Name type)

deal more gracefully with inconsistent types on evaluation
     currently pattern-match failure in Core
     can deal with via `fail` in state monad?


Design:
determine correct computaional model under morphemes
	  ?reversible?
